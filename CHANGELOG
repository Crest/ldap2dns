Version 0.2.3
+ Check for next availabe server in /etc/ldap.conf
  if first one is unavialable.

Version 0.2.2
- Tested with djbdns-1.05

- Removed compleatly the possibility to create a binary data.cdb file.
  Reasons:
  * It just takes a few milliseconds to create a data.cdb file with 
    tinydns-data. 
  * Its much safer to have an ASCII data file handy just in case 
    something goes wrong.
  * I am too lazy to adopt ldap2dns for each new version of djbdns.
  * ldap2dns does not have to be linked statically against any other
    package.

- Now the output option takes parameters data and/or db instead
  of numbers.

Version 0.2.1
- Additional attribute in DNSrrset: DNScipaddr
  Canonical IP address, which when used instead
  of DNSipaddr automatically resolves reverse.

- Using Environement Variables LDAP2DNS_UPDATE and
  LDAP2DNS_OUTPUT for default values used by ldap2dns.

- If started as daemon, does not exit if connection to
  LDAP server fails but tries to reconnect after a timeout.

- An external program can be called if ldap2dns detects a
  modification in the database.

Version 0.2.0
- New schema, unfortunately not compatible with old one, but
  now its unambigous.

- Mapping for reverse lookup works fine.

- ldap2dns now can be started by daemontools.

- Fixed a bug for DNSrrset's with type=TXT

- Much better naming scheme for dn's when using
  import.pl

- RPM support
