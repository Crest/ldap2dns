Make sure you have the OpenLDAP version 2 include files installed.

For Red Hat, this would be the openldap-devel package
for SuSE, this would be the openldap2-devel package

Type "make" in the current directory.  If all goes well follow up with a 
"make install"

To create an RPM, use one of the following commands:

make DISTRIBUTION=redhat rpm
make DISTRIBUTION=suse rpm

if you are running Red Hat or SuSE respectively.

For updates, changes and some documentation, see http://projects.alkaloid.net

Please send any problem or success reports to the maintainer.
