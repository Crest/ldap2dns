1) What happened to the webadmin directory?

2005-12-07 bklang
I have deprecated that code in favor of another project I am working on.  It
is called Beatnik and is a Horde framework module.  The status of the webadmin
code was unclear and I was not willing to support it so I deprecated it.  I 
left it as part of the tarball release and in version control in case others
out there felt differently and/or it ever needed to be modified or even revived.

As far as I'm concerned you are welcome to use it but consequently are on your
own.  You might also contact the author, Jacob Rief (jacob.rief@tiscover.com)
for more information but he is no longer interested in maintaing this work
so do not depend on him.

Right after I mailed you, I patched the schema :)
I moved from IA5 Strings to Numeric Strings in that section of the schema:

attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7222.1.4.12
        NAME 'dnsipaddr'
        EQUALITY numericStringMatch
        SUBSTR numericStringSubstringsMatch
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.36{16} )

attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7222.1.4.13
        NAME 'dnscipaddr'
        EQUALITY numericStringMatch
        SUBSTR numericStringSubstringsMatch
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.36{16} )

Thanks for the quick reply. Take care.
