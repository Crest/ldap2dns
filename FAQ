1) My build bails out with nearly three screens full of error messages!
2006-10-04 bklang

If the first two lines of that error output look like:

ldap2dns.c:9:18: error: lber.h: No such file or directory
ldap2dns.c:10:18: error: ldap.h: No such file or directory

then you need to make the include files available to the compiler.  Usually that
means that the openldap-devel (openldap2-devel for SuSE) package needs to be
installed.  If you're running on Solaris or have installed OpenLDAP into a
non-standard location then you'll need to modify the Makefile to pass the path
to those header files to the compiler.

2) How do I use DNS TXT records?
(Or: Why do I need that trailing '.'?)
(Or: Why do my DNS TXT records get corrupted?)
2006-10-19 bklang
Due to an original design decision, ldap2dns uses the DNScname attribute to 
store DNS TXT data.  This field is normally checked to see if it should be 
expanded to include a trailing domain name (that is, any string that does not 
end with a '.').  The "best" way to create  DNS txt record for now is to create
the TXT entry as you normally would, then simply append a '.'.  The '.' will not
be included in the resulting record and will prevent expansion or other 
modification of the record.

This limitation is scheduled to be corrected around ldap2dns version 0.4.2.
Tentatively, this will see the introduction of a new attribute dedicated to
TXT records that will bypass any form of expansion.


3) Where can I find a web interface?
2005-06-06 bklang

The official web interface of ldap2dns is "Beatnik."  Beatnik is a module for
the Horde framework (http://www.horde.org).  Beatnik is actively developed and
should be ready for release soon.  Early adopters are encouraged to checkout
the code from SVN trunk.  The author uses Beatnik productively today.

See http://projects.alkaloid.net for more information.


4) What happened to the webadmin directory?

2005-12-22 bklang
** See security note at the end of this section regarding the old webadmin **

I have deprecated that code in favor of another project I am working on.  It
is called Beatnik and is a Horde framework module.  The status of the webadmin
code was unclear and I was not willing to support it so I deprecated it.  I 
left it as part of the tarball release and in version control in case others
out there felt differently and/or it ever needed to be modified or even revived.

As far as I'm concerned you are welcome to use it but consequently are on your
own.  You might also contact the author, Jacob Rief (jacob.rief@tiscover.com)
for more information but he is no longer interested in maintaing this work
so do not depend on him.

During a routine code audit on the ldap2dns sources a number of potential LDAP
injection vulnerabilities were discovered.  Since this code is deprecated no
attempt to correct these flaws has been made. 


IF YOU CHOOSE TO RUN THE DEPRECATED WEBADMIN SOFTWARE:  Please take all
necessary steps to secure your environment.  The author of this package takes no
responsibility for any problems related to the flawed webadmin code.

Thanks to Erik Cabetas for bringing these issues to my attention.


5) Why have you deprecated all that code?

2005-12-07 bklang
This is partially answered above, but to fully answer the question it's not
any comment or criticism of the original author.  Really it is just code that
appears to me to be somewhat extraneous to what I consider to be the core
functionality of ldap2dns.  That combined with my desire to focus on the core
functionality and not maintain this other work leads me to note the status of
that code to others who may use this package.  The code may or may not work;
you are entirely on your own.  If demand is sufficient some parts may come back
into the main tarball.  However for now I leave it there in case anyone out
there wants it.  It is unmaintained (at least by me) and should not be
considered stable or even working unless you audit it yourself.
You have been warned. Caveat emptor.
